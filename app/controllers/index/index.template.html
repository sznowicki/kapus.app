			<p>tl;dr: set a room name, optionally protect with password. Paste on one device, copy on another; no matter where is it.</p>
			<p>To log in to existing room, use same room name and pass.</p>
			<p>Warning: if you don't set a password, or someone guess it, your data will leak.</p>
			<p>Warning2: this website keeps your stuff in server memory, no database involved, no encryption. Data is not persistent. Will be destroyed after a minute.</p>
			<p>I promise not to look into the memory, but again, it's not encrypted (yet). Just saying.</p>
			<p>I keep no historical clipboards. Once you save, only latest state is kept in memory.</p>
			<p>If you don't trust me, you can <a href="https://github.com/sznowicki/kapus.app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-host</a> it.</p>
